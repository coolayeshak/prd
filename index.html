The father of the girl is seeking matches from religious, well-educated, and reputable families of upper-middle-class to affluent backgrounds, with a strong preference for those from the northern districts of Kerala up to Ernakulam. While this geographical preference is for practical reasons, the primary requirement is the ability to conduct verifiable and comprehensive background checks. While proposals from other locations are less encouraged, they might be considered if reliable methods for thorough verification can be established.




Indeed, Allah is sufficient for anyone who trusts in Him. In terms of our preferences, we prioritize proposals within certain parameters, like a minimum financial threshold which is why terms like upper-class, well-off, or affluent are mentioned. This is simply to help guide the process and ensure compatibility, Inshallah.




The girl’s perspective? It’s given below.




If I have overlooked anything important or failed to express a key concern or information, kindly forgive me. My intention is to be as open, respectful, and thoughtful as possible in exploring what it means to share a life together.

I am looking for a spouse who strives for a balanced life - someone deeply rooted in Islamic values while being emotionally mature, intellectually grounded, and ethically unwavering. Deen is a core pillar in my life, and I value a partner who is genuinely and consistently working to improve in their religious practice - not just outwardly, but with sincerity, humility, and integrity. Someone who understands tawakkul, tries to pray five times a day consistently, fasts, avoids haram (including interest-based dealings and gambling), and respects the accountability we have in the aakhirah. I admire someone who understands the concepts in the Qur’an and genuinely strives to live by them.

I am also seeking someone who is ambitious and career-oriented - but not merely for the sake of money, status, or prestige (even though financial stability is important). I would like to be with a person who aspires to make a meaningful difference in the world  - someone whose goals rise above superficial milestones, someone who pursues excellence, views their work as both a path of personal growth and a means of serving others, guided by a sense of spiritual responsibility. I really connect with this purpose-driven, impact, worship -focused mindset, and it’s something I try to live by in my own journey.
Character and emotional intelligence. I appreciate a partner who communicates with honesty, kindness, who can handle conflicts with humility and fairness and apologize when needed. I do not expect perfection, but I do seek humility and accountability. I agree it's something we both need to coordinate.

In a similar spirit of mutual respect and transparency, I am committed to my professional aspirations in research (currently Quantum Computing EDA/Compilation,Transpilation Efficiency). I have worked hard to build a meaningful trajectory in this space, and I would appreciate a spouse who respects my ambition, supports intellectual growth, and can handle mutual independence with grace. I value transparency around career decisions, finances, and future planning - including things like location, employability, and handling setbacks like layoffs. (Open to further discussion around these points)

Financial ethics are non-negotiable. I am looking for someone who is transparent about their financial dealings, repays debts, values earning through halal means and avoids penny-pinching behavior. Someone who isn’t obsessed with wealth but sees financial planning as a responsibility - balancing the pursuit of rizq and accountability to Allah. 

I have not had any past romantic relationships, and I deeply value emotional exclusivity and modesty. While having innocent crushes is natural and human, my boundary lies in how those feelings are acted upon. If someone had a crush and chose to present it respectfully - by involving the individual or her family with the intention of marriage, adhering to Islamic protocols from the moment feelings arose - that is completely understandable and respected.

However, casual dating, emotional entanglements, friends-with-benefits, one-night stands, or ( major and minor) physical involvement outside the bounds of marriage are firm non-negotiables. I’m not comfortable with someone who has had long-term past romantic relationships - whether it was six months, two, three, or five years. This isn't about judging anyone's past; I understand that people have different life experiences. I’m looking for someone with a similar experience and background in this regard. Similarly, alcohol and drugs are non-negotiable boundaries. Even if you’ve only “tasted” or “experimented,” I am not very happy with that. [ But Allah is all forgiving :) ]

I believe in a kind, fun-loving, and mutually respectful partnership - not a control-based adjustment model. At the same time, I’m not a fan of the "babysitting" approach  - each of us should be capable and considerate without creating dependency or unnecessary friction.

I want to approach this journey with honesty, clarity, and intention - acknowledging my flaws and  being realistic. Lastly, I am not a perfect person by any means and I’m not looking for perfection, just sincerity, character, and shared values.
